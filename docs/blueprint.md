- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headings and body text to maintain a clean, modern aesthetic. Alternatively, 'Space Grotesk' can be used for headings, when a more technical, modern feel is needed.
- Use a consistent grid system across all dashboards to maintain a professional and organized look.
- Use a set of consistent icons from a library like FontAwesome or Material Icons to represent actions and categories within the dashboards.
